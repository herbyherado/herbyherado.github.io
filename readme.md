##About Me
Hi, my name is Herby - currently enrolled in a coding bootcamp.

Previously had several experience in project (construction) management, validation for pharmaceutical industries and auditing but up until recently just found how _fun_ coding can be.

Looking forward and expecting on having a career switch in the next couple of months. :computer:

Wish me luck! :four_leaf_clover:
